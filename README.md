### CraveCart

## Introduction
CraveCart is a web-based food delivery platform designed to connect customers with local home-based food businesses, often referred to as cloud kitchens. It aims to empower passionate cooks—especially homemakers or aspiring entrepreneurs—who are unable to start traditional food businesses due to financial, personal, or logistical constraints.

By providing a platform where only verified home kitchens can register and offer meals, CraveCart creates a trusted environment that delivers hygienic, authentic, and home-cooked food directly to customers’ doorsteps.

## Problem Statement
Many talented home cooks are eager to turn their skills into a livelihood but are held back by high startup costs, limited access to commercial spaces, or responsibilities that prevent them from working outside the home. Meanwhile, consumers are increasingly skeptical of restaurant hygiene and seek healthier alternatives.

CraveCart solves these issues by:

Providing a dedicated platform for cloud kitchens to register, list, and manage their offerings.

Enabling customers to find nearby kitchens through location-based discovery.

Emphasizing trust, hygiene, and a sense of community in food services.
